# repo-popularity-stats

Simple tool to check whether a repo you are interested in is going viral. May be useful to check where you are in the "competitive advantage landscape".

## How to use

The code is a simple Jupyter notebook, quite self-explanatory.

It queries GitHub's API, which has different limits for registered/unregistered requests.
